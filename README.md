# Analog-IC-Design

This repository contain the design,simulation and analysi of an interface circuit for a MEMS microphone,developed during an internship on Analog IC Design.The project involved::

- Modeling the MEMS microphone with a Thevenin equivalent.
- Design, simulation, and circuit characterization of a low-noise Op-Amp preamplifier (TI OPA344 reference) using ngspice.
- Schematic capture using Xschem and circuit analysis (DC/transient) with ngspice.
- Application of passive RLC modeling, KCL, KVL, and superposition.
- Network analysis plus Thevenin/Norton transformations for optimized power transfer.
- Analog building block design/analysis: current mirrors, differential amplifiers, and MOS characteristics.
- Complete system simulation and robust USB-MIDI audio characterization.
